    <h1>JAVA</h1>
    <P>Java is an object-oriented, class-based programming language. The language is designed to have as few dependencies implementations as possible. The intention of using this language is to give relief to the developers from writing codes for every platform. The term WORA, write once and run everywhere is often associated with this language. It means whenever we compile a Java code, we get the byte code (.class file), and that can be executed (without compiling it again) on different platforms provided they support Java. In the year 1995, Java language was developed. It is mainly used to develop web, desktop, and mobile devices. The Java language is known for its robustness, security, and simplicity features. That is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</P>
    <P>The Java language has a very interesting history. Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan, and Jame Gosling, known as the Green team, started the development of Java in the year 1991. These people were the engineers at Sun Microsystems. In 1996, the first public implementation was released as Java 1.0. The compiler of Java 1.0 was rewritten by Arthur Van Hoff to comply strictly with its specification. With the introduction of Java 2, the new versions have multiple different configurations that have been built for the various platforms. It is worth noting that James Gosling is also known as the father of Java.</P>

   <p>Today, most of the websites are built using MVC (model view controller) architecture. In MVC architecture, React is the 'V' which stands for view, whereas the architecture is provided by the Redux or Flux.ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components.

    <h1>SQL</h1>
    <P>Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational database. A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. You can use SQL statements to store, update, remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.</P>
   <P>Structured query language (SQL) is a popular query language that is frequently used in all types of applications. Data analysts and developers learn and use SQL because it integrates well with different programming languages. For example, they can embed SQL queries with the Java programming language to build high-performing data processing applications with major SQL database systems such as Oracle or MS SQL Server. SQL is also fairly easy to learn as it uses common English keywords in its statements</P>
