According to a 2019 study published by The Lancet, which analyzed the health effects of poor diet across 195 countries, 11 million deaths and 255 million disability-adjusted life-years were attributed to dietary risk factors. We aim to improve health through better food and nutrition research, education, programs, and policies.Good food is not just about taste, and diet is not just about achieving an ideal weight or dress size.
